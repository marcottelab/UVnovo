**_Important notice (Feb 27, 2017):_ This repository will be updated in the coming two weeks (early March 2017) to reflect our just accepted manuscript at [Analytical Chemistry] (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00130).**

The initial release will include all code and parameters we use for the paper, so that our anlaysis is reproducible on any machine. We are uploading raw data and results to the [MassIVE] (http://massive.ucsd.edu/) public mass spectrometry data repository and will update this page soon with a [ProteomeXchange] (http://www.proteomexchange.org/) dataset ID.
