str2doubleq http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28893-fast-string-to-double-conversion
	This mex function *should* be a drop-in replacement for the builtin str2doubleq().
	It provides MASSIVE speed improvements when dealing with large arrays (at least up to MATLAB R2013a).
	However, it's not always safe to use.
	It now returns (real + im) in R2013a, and I don't remember that happening in an older release.
	It also differs by eps() for some conversions.
	Also, there are a few special-case inconsistencies between str2doubleq and str2double, for example when there is a comma (thousands separator).	See comments at the link above.

rgb http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24497-rgb-triple-of-color-name--version-2
	Return rgb color values given color name(s). Very useful for plotting.
