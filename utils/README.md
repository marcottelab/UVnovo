# utils

Simple utilities not specific to UVnovo or mass spectrometry.

Many of these functions will likely be removed once the repo has stabilized.

I use some of these tools while developing, for example `io.cp` and `cleanws`, and they're not required by UVnovo.

Likewise, there are a few UVnovo dependencies that I want to remove, like `io.getfilepath` and `io.import_tdl`.
